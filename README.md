These codes were used to generate the results presented in the article "Some results about the structural properties of the Wnt pathway, its steady states and its non-associative commutative algebra"
(see https://academic.oup.com/imammb/article-abstract/42/4/359/8230249 ). In particular, they can be used to  compute all siphons of the CRN and all NACA of the related system of 
quadratic polynomial ordinary differential equations.
